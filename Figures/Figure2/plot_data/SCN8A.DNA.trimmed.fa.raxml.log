Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search
  start tree(s): random (10) + parsimony (10)
  random seed: 1659768920
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  fast spr radius: AUTO
  spr subtree cutoff: 1.000000
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: SSE3
  parallelization: coarse-grained (auto), PTHREADS (auto)

WARNING: Running in REDO mode: existing checkpoints are ignored, and all result files will be overwritten!

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GTR+G) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
