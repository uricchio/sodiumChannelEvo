MissingOutputException in line 128 of /Users/uricchio/projects/poison/sodiumChannelPaper/Figures/Figure2/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
plot_data/SCN4A.DNA.trimmed.wTree.MEME.json completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 47
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
