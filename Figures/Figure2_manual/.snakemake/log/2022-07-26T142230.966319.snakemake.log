Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 69 of /Users/uricchio/projects/poison/sodiumChannelPaper/Figures/Figure2/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
plot_data/SCN3A.columns completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 26
Removing output files of failed job trim_bad_columns since they might be corrupted:
plot_data/SCN3A.trimmedCol.fa
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
