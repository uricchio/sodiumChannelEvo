rule make_concord:
    input: ../../Data/trees_xenPum_ref
    output: plot_data/trees_xenPum_ref.txt

Error in rule make_concord:
    jobid: 1
    output: plot_data/trees_xenPum_ref.txt
    shell:
        ./make_trees.sh ../../Data/trees_xenPum_ref - > plot_data/trees_xenPum_ref.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job make_concord since they might be corrupted:
plot_data/trees_xenPum_ref.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
