Error in rule make_lens:
    jobid: 4
    output: plot_data/lens_xen.txt
    shell:
        ./make_lens.sh ../../Data/alignments_xen - > plot_data/lens_xen.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job make_lens since they might be corrupted:
plot_data/lens_xen.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
