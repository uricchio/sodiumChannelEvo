Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	make_concord
	1	make_lens
	1	plot_data
	4
Select jobs to execute...

rule make_concord:
    input: ../../Data/trees_full_assemb
    output: plot_data/trees_full_assemb.txt
    jobid: 1
    wildcards: sample=full_assemb

Error in rule make_concord:
    jobid: 1
    output: plot_data/trees_full_assemb.txt
    shell:
        ./make_trees_all.sh ../../Data/trees_full_assemb - > plot_data/trees_full_assemb.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job make_concord since they might be corrupted:
plot_data/trees_full_assemb.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
