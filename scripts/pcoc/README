Files in this directory correspond to running PCOC on our alignments/trees.

Frist step is to run "./runAllPruning.sh". This uses dendropy to prune the trees such 
that we only include species for which we have toxicity data, and then we generate 
PDFs that show the labeling of nodes within PCOC. At this point we need to stop and manually 
create the list of nodes that have toxicity, which correspond to our foreground sets in 
PCOC for our convergence test.

After manaully labeling the nodes, we can run PCOC as
